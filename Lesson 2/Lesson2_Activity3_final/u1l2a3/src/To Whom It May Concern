To Whom It May Concern

I have supervised Ashley Pembroke’s for 3 years while she worked as a Project Officer at Providence Environmental Care. I wish to recommend her for the Charles Wallace Scholarship Program as I believe that this will help her pursue her dream of studying for a degree in Environmental Sciences and Wildlife.

Ashley is one of the most brilliant project officers at our organization. Recently, she reined in freeing the prisoned Bali dolphins through sheer will and her passion for nature conservation. I believe that if she has a higher degree in environmental sciences and wildlife, she will be able to contribute to the wellbeing of our planet and its ecology.

As a hardworking individual, Ashley has always come out on top. She is fascinated with the smallest of wonders which shows her strong character and is extremely easy to get along with. To sum it up, I believe that she is a deserving candidate for the Charles Wallace Scholarship – it will be money well-spent.

Please feel free to contact me if you need any further information regarding Ashley’s suitability for the program.

 

Sincerely,
